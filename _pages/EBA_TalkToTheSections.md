The purpose of each section in the blueprint is outlined here:

**Aligning to Government Priorities**
This section establishes the strategic drivers that influence and inform the rest of the Blueprint. The Province of British Columbia Strategic Plan 2015/16 – 2018/19 (layer 1) and Where Ideas Work (layer 2) set the overarching direction to which digital transformation must align. The Sector Strategies layer represents the business strategies and objectives specific to each sector that must be facilitated by lower levels in the diagram

**Defining the Business Context**
This section is all about setting out the phases for the EBA Approach. Its purpose it to help stakeholders succinctly describe their business needs and design the services required to meet these needs. The key is that it embeds EBA throughout the lifecycle of an initiative providing guidance every step of the way. 
With a strong focus on measuring success, the Benefits Realization layer supports the creation of measurable outcomes and metrics that align with the phases of the lifecycle.

**Modernizing the Technical Foundation**
The section fuses the traditional domains from enterprise architecture (TOGAF) and the OCIO technology enablers (5 pillars) with the future state service needs of our citizens. A matrix is used where the intersection of an EA domain and a pillar informs the service owner of how a technology can empower them to meet their service transformation goals. 

**Streamlining Service Creation and Delivery**
The final section of the Blueprint identifies facilitating components that should be consumed by service owners. These “corporate enablers” are cross-government business enablers that provide value to both the citizen and government. Implementing services with these common components helps ensure consistent customer experience and predictable outcomes. 

By aligning to this set of strategies, enablers, and common services, owners will have the enterprise knowledge required to make better decisions and produce better outcomes for their initiatives. We believe that the Blueprint in concert with the EBA Approach are at the centre of this alignment exercise as the business and technology context they provide are the keys to a successful digital transformation for government and the citizens of British Columbia.
