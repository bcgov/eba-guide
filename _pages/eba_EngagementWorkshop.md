title: The Alignment Workshop
---  
 
The Alignment Process consists of two engagements. First is the Alignment workshop where architects from the OICO work with a small team related to an initiative and walk through the Alignment Guide which is a series of questions to help both parties understand where current alignment is strong and adjustments can be made for greater success. It is designed to be quick, light-weight, and produce immediate feedback for the stakeholder. The characteristics of the Alignment Workshop are:

**_Time commitment:_** two hours

**_Team commitment:_** two or three members of the initiative

**_Artifact:_** The Alignment Guide

**_Stakeholder value:_** Understanding of enterprise alignment and objectives; higher awareness of enablers
