title: The Alignment Workshop
---  
 
The Alignment Process consists of two engagements. First is the Alignment workshop where architects from the OICO work with a small team related to an initiative and walk through the Alignment Guide which is a series of questions to help both parties understand where current alignment is strong and adjustments can be made for greater success. It is designed to be quick, light-weight, and produce immediate feedback for the stakeholder. The characteristics of the Alignment Workshop are:

**Time commitment: **  two hours
**Team commitment: **  two or three members of the initiative
**Artifact: ** The Alignment Guide
**Stakeholder value: ** Understanding of enterprise alignment and objectives; higher enablers awareness
