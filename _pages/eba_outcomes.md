title: EBA Outcomes
---
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Blueprint seeks to address User Stories like the following:

INCREASE UTILIZATION OF CORPORATE ENABLERS 
As a service owner, I want to understand the capabilities of government’s corporate enablers and how they support my initiative, so that I can use them to reduce the cost of my solution, expedite it’s time to delivery, and bring consistency to my audience.
# Current feedback: It is too expensive (in time, or resources, or financial investment) today for me to consume “corporate enablers.”

INCREASE MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES
As a service owner, I want the Blueprint and EBA Approach to provide me with a benefits realization framework for measuring and monitoring the performance of my service against its defined outcomes, so that I can continually evaluate its operations, identify opportunities to realign services / products based on changing stakeholder needs, and provide empirical feedback to my executive on successes and challenges.

INCREASED ALIGNMENT BETWEEN SERVICE DECISIONS MADE AND DIGITAL GOVERNMENT STRATEGY
As a service owner, I want the Blueprint to provide clear direction on the design of digital services that align with government strategy, so that I know my initiative aligns with government priorities while the work I do reduces technical diversity and complexity.

INCREASE AWARENESS OF CITIZENS
As a service owner, I want the Blueprint to provide insight into the relationship between citizen, government, and complexity and the impact to all three on the decisions I make, so that when I build a service the citizen receives an exemplary, consistent experience, government achieves maximum value for its investment, and the service deployed meets user needs consistent with the goals of digital government.

INCREASE EVIDENCE-BASED DECISION MAKING ACROSS ALL PHASES OF AN INITIATIVE 
As a service owner, I want empirical evidence to defend every service investment decision so I am certain the optimal investment portfolio serves citizens.
