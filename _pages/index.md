In 2015-16, The Deputy Minister’s Council for Transformation and Technology (DMCTT) asked the Government Chief Information Officer (GCIO) to produce a framework that lays a foundation for digital government. 

Based on feedback, a deeper understanding of goals, and updated enterprise strategy documents, this evolution, the Enterprise Business Architecture 2017 - Digital Government Blueprint for BC, focusses on:
*Delivering a more easily-consumable framework
*Identifying enablers for digital government
*Communicating an EBA engagement approach that strengthens alignment to strategic goals, provides guidance for success, and gathers feedback on itself.

“The Blueprint,” as it is known, and EBA Engagement Approach will provide benefits to government by:
*Guiding the evolution of digital enablers 
*Facilitating collaboration across service areas
*Assisting in the prioritization of service initiatives, and 
*Identifying opportunities to leverage corporate enablers
