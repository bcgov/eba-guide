In 2015-16, The Deputy Minister’s Council for Transformation and Technology (DMCTT) asked the Government Chief Information Officer (GCIO) to produce a framework that lays a foundation for digital government. 

Feedback on previous versions has shaped the evolution of this work, as has a deeper understanding of government goals, and updated enterprise strategy documents. (The entire collection of current ministry service plans can be found via a Google search for "BC gov ministry service plans".) This evolution, the *Enterprise Business Architecture 2017 - Digital Government Blueprint for BC*, focusses on:

* Delivering a more easily-consumable framework
* Identifying enablers for digital government
* Communicating an EBA engagement approach that strengthens alignment to strategic goals, providing guidance for success, and 
* Gathering feedback on the framework and the engagement approach.

“The Blueprint,” as it is known, and the EBA Engagement Approach will provide benefits to government by:

* Guiding the evolution of digital enablers 
* Facilitating collaboration across service areas
* Assisting in the prioritization of service initiatives, and 
* Identifying opportunities to leverage corporate enablers.
